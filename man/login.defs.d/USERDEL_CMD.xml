      Here is an example script, which removes the user's
      cron, at and print jobs:
      <programlisting>
#! /bin/sh

# Check for the required argument.
if [ $# != 1 ]; then
	echo "Usage: $0 username"
	exit 1
fi

# Remove cron jobs.
crontab -r -u $1

# Remove at jobs.
# Note that it will remove any jobs owned by the same UID,
# even if it was shared by a different username.
AT_SPOOL_DIR=/var/spool/cron/atjobs
find $AT_SPOOL_DIR -name "[^.]*" -type f -user $1 -delete \;

# Remove print jobs.
lprm $1

# All done.
exit 0
      </programlisting>
