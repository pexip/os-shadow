    <para>
      Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
      algorithm. If set to <replaceable>yes</replaceable>, new passwords
      will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the
      one used by recent releases of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of
      unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to
      <replaceable>no</replaceable> if you need to copy encrypted
      passwords to other systems which don't understand the new algorithm.
      Default is <replaceable>no</replaceable>.
    </para>
